# Vue.js Labs at ITI

Welcome to the Vue.js Labs repository for your ITI course! This repository contains the solutions and resources for the Vue.js labs conducted during your course.

## Introduction

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It provides a simple and flexible API for building interactive web interfaces with reactive data binding and component-based architecture.

These labs are designed to help you understand the fundamentals of Vue.js, including components, directives, state management with Vuex, routing with Vue Router, and more.

## Installation

To start working with Vue.js on your Windows machine, you need to set up a development environment. Here's how to get started:

1. **Node.js and npm**: Vue.js projects typically require Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies and running build scripts. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the installation instructions. npm is included with Node.js.

2. **Vue CLI**: Vue CLI (Command Line Interface) is a globally installed npm package that provides a modern development toolset for Vue.js projects. You can install Vue CLI using npm:

**npm install -g @vue/cli**


This will install the latest version of Vue CLI globally on your system.

3. **Create a New Vue Project**: Once Vue CLI is installed, you can create a new Vue project using the following command:

**vue create project-name**


Follow the prompts to choose the features and configurations for your project.

## Usage

Each lab session is organized into separate directories within this repository. Inside each directory, you'll find the Vue.js project files, along with any additional resources or instructions provided during the lab session.

To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/KarimMohamedDesouki/Vue-Labs.git


Then, navigate to the specific lab directory you're interested in and explore the Vue.js project files and resources.
